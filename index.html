        <p class="conventional_section_paragraph">
          At H.I.A Conventional Section, we are committed to nurturing students
          through a holistic educational approach that integrates Islamic morals
          and respect for cultural and societal values. Our curriculum
          emphasizes the importance of fluency in the English language,
          effective communication skills, and the development of creative and
          self-reliant abilities. By combining conventional and Islamic
          teachings, we provide a balanced foundation for sound Western
          education. Our program aims to foster moral integrity, presentable
          character, critical thinking, and logical judgment. We also strive to
          instill a sense of respect and love for one's country, promoting
          harmonious coexistence and adherence to laws.

          communicate effectively, along with mastering the memorization and
          recitation of the Holy Qur'an. Our curriculum includes short-term
          training in reading and writing skills, fostering moral development,
          and promoting presentable character. We provide a well-designed
          curriculum that ensures every individual has the right to learn and
          grow. Additionally, we emphasize critical thinking and logical
          judgment, and we operate an integrated system with conventional
          schools.
